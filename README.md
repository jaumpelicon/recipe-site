#Recipe Website

This project aims to build a responsive recipe website using HTML and CSS for my fullstack MBA challenge at rocketseat, designed to follow a structured Figma layout. The website features a modern and user-friendly interface, offering an organized collection of recipes complete with ingredients, instructions, and images. By adhering to the Figma design, the website maintains a cohesive and visually appealing layout across different devices.

Features:

- Clean and modern design based on a Figma prototype
- Organized recipe categories with detailed information
- Fully responsive design for optimal viewing on all screen sizes
